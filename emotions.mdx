### Owner

### App user

## User connections
Usually, an `app` user connects to an `owner` device to manage the device. When the app user connects, it will show as a contact to the `owner` device.  

An `app` user can be connect to multiple `owners` (for example, a son may connect to the assistant of both of his parents). 

An `owner` device can be connected with multiple `app` users (for example, it could connect to multiple family members).

App users are able to view and edit multiple preferences, start and receive videocalls, and send images and audiomessages to the `owner` device.
