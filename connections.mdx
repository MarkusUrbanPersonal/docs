## User types

We use two main types of users, stored in the same database table. 
A user can be either an `owner` or an `app` user.

### Owner
Refers to an assistant owner, the one that owns a Cati device at home. 

### App user
Refers to a mobile app user, usually a family member of the `owner`

## User connections
Usually, an `app` user connects to an `owner` device to manage the device. When the app user connects, it will show as a contact to the `owner` device.  

An `app` user can be connect to multiple `owners` (for example, a son may connect to the assistant of both of his parents). 

An `owner` device can be connected with multiple `app` users (for example, it could connect to multiple family members).

App users are able to view and edit multiple preferences, start and receive videocalls, and send images and audiomessages to the `owner` device.
