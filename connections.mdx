## User types

We use two main types of users, stored in the same database table. 
A user can be either an `owner` or an `app` user.

### Owner
Refers to an assistant owner, the one that owns a Cati device at home. 

### App user
Refers to a mobile app user, usually a family member of the `owner`

## User connections
Usually, an `app` user connects to an `owner` device to manage the device. When the app user connects, it will show as a contact to the `owner` device.  
App users are also able to view and edit multiple preferences, start and receive videocalls, and send images and audiomessages to the owner. 

An `app` user can be connect to multiple `owners` (for example, a son may connect to the assistant of both of his parents). 

An `owner` device can be connected with multiple `app` users (for example, it could connect - and therefore be managed - by all the sons of the family).
