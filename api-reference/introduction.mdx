<Note>
  We use a unified API across our assistant and our connected mobile app. Some endpoints add the mobile suffix to indicate that they're mobile specific
</Note>

## Authentication

Almost all API endpoints reqire authentication, using a `token` parameter that represents a user identity.

```json
{
    "token": "**********"
}
```
